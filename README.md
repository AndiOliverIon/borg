### Install via Git Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/borg.git
```

### Install via PowerShell Gallery (if published)
```powershell
Install-Module Borg -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Inject into your PowerShell profile
```powershell
# >>> BORG INITIALIZATION START <<<
Import-Module Borg
# Optionally create a shortcut alias
Set-Alias b borg
# <<< BORG INITIALIZATION END >>>
```

### üîß Initialize Configuration

When you run any `borg` command (including `borg --version`) for the first time, BORG will automatically initialize your personal configuration by copying `store.example.json` into your user profile folder:

```
%APPDATA%\borg\store.json
```

This file stores your custom settings, such as SQL container names, backup paths, credentials, and more.

To edit your configuration, run:

```powershell
borg store
```

This will open your `store.json` in your preferred editor (e.g. Micro, Notepad, or VS Code depending on how you've configured `borg store` internally).

Alternatively, you can manually edit:

```
%APPDATA%\borg\store.json
```

Any changes you make here will be picked up immediately by all BORG commands.



Example configuration:
```json
{  
  "Docker": {
    "SqlContainer": "sqlserver-2022",
    "SqlInstance": "localhost,2022",
    "SqlImageTag": "mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest",
    "SqlPort": 1433,
    "SqlUser": "sa",
    "SqlPassword": "yourStrong(!)Password"
  },
  "Bookmarks": [
    { "alias": "dtemp", "path": "D:\\temp" },
    { "alias": "kit",   "path": "C:\\Users\\youruser\\kits" }
  ]
}
```

## Known Issues
Error: Profile cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
Solution:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```

##   How It Works

BORG is a modular CLI automation toolkit. It works by chaining interactive PowerShell scripts and terminal tools to manage and orchestrate tasks like:

- ‚õ¥Ô∏è Starting and managing SQL Server containers
-   Uploading and restoring `.bak` and `.bacpac` files
-   Extracting or comparing database schemas
- üîÅ Syncing files with Google Drive via `rclone`
- üóÇÔ∏è Browsing and exporting Jira worklogs or issues
-   Backing up local SQL Server instances

Each command guides you interactively, uses fuzzy navigation (via `fzf`), and integrates with tools like `sqlpackage`, `rclone`, and `less` when available.


---

## üì± Mobile Companion App

A mobile app is currently in development to make BORG even more accessible when you're away from your workstation.

It focuses on quick, practical interactions ‚Äî such as:

- Checking the status of your stations
- Running key commands with a few taps
- Shutting down a station remotely

Designed to be lightweight and efficient, the app brings core BORG workflows into your pocket without overwhelming you with options.

---

## üîí Compatibility

-   SQL Server 2022
-   PowerShell 7.5.1+ (Windows Powershell is not supported)
-   Docker (Windows, Linux)
-   ODBC Driver 18+ (TLS-safe)

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Drive Integration (via rclone)

To enable file uploads to Google Drive, BORG relies on [rclone](https://rclone.org), a powerful CLI tool for managing cloud storage.

##   Jira Integration

BORG provides two built-in commands to view your worklog activity in Jira:

- `borg jira today`: Shows today's worklogs grouped by issue
- `borg jira week`: Displays the worklogs for the current week

To use these, you'll need to:

1. Create a [Jira API token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Store the following information in your `store.json`:

```json
"Jira": {
  "Domain": "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net",
  "Email": "your.email@company.com",
  "APIToken": "your-api-token"
}
```

### Setup Steps

1. Download `rclone.exe` from [rclone.org/downloads](https://rclone.org/downloads) and place it in a known location (e.g. `C:\utility-scripts\rclone.exe`).

2. Follow the [rclone Google Drive setup guide](https://rclone.org/drive/) to create a remote configuration and generate your `rclone.conf`.

3. In your `store.json`, specify:
   - The full path to `rclone.exe`
   - The remote name and optional working path (e.g. subfolder)

Example `store.json` snippet:
```json
"Rclone": {
  "ExecutablePath": "C:\\utility-scripts\\rclone.exe",
  "RemoteName": "gdrive",
  "RemotePath": "borg-backups"
}
```

Make sure your `rclone.conf` includes the credentials for the `gdrive` remote, and that you‚Äôve granted it access to the intended Google Drive folder.

Once configured, use:

```powershell
borg gdrive upload
```

to upload files interactively using `fzf` from the current directory.

## üßπ Uninstalling BORG

If you want to remove the BORG module:

```powershell
Uninstall-Module Borg -AllVersions -Force
```

To remove it manually:

```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\Borg" -Recurse -Force
```

To clean it from your profile:

```powershell
(Get-Content $PROFILE) | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch 'Import-Module Borg' } | Set-Content $PROFILE
```

## üñß SSH Setup for Borg on Windows Stations

To ensure remote SSH sessions land in **PowerShell 7+** and automatically load the Borg module, follow these steps on each station:

### ‚úÖ 1. Install Borg system-wide
Run from an **elevated PowerShell 7+ terminal**:
```powershell
Install-Module Borg -Scope AllUsers -Force
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Add PowerShell 7 to the system PATH (if not already)
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Program Files\PowerShell", "Machine")
```

> üìå This ensures `pwsh` is discoverable in all contexts, including system services like `sshd`.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Set PowerShell 7 as the default shell for SSH
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH" `
  -Name DefaultShell `
  -Value "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe" `
  -PropertyType String -Force
```

Then apply the change:
```powershell
Restart-Service sshd
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Verify SSH opens `pwsh`
From a remote machine:
```bash
ssh yourUser@stationName
```

Then confirm:
```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

You should see PowerShell 7.x.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Add Borg auto-import to PowerShell profile

Run inside the `pwsh` session to determine the correct profile path:
```powershell
$PROFILE
```

Then open the file locally or remotely and append:
```powershell
# >>> BORG INITIALIZATION START <<<
Import-Module Borg
# Optionally create a shortcut alias
Set-Alias b borg
# <<< BORG INITIALIZATION END <<<
```

> üí° Use `$PROFILE.AllUsersCurrentHost` to apply it for all users on the station.

---

Once complete, any SSH session will:
- Start in PowerShell 7+
- Load the Borg module
- Enable quick access via `borg` or `b` commands
