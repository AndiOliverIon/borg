## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Borg relies on a few modern terminal utilities to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.

| Tool    | Purpose                          | Install Command          |
|---------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `fzf`   | Fuzzy finder for file selection  | `winget install fzf`     |
| `micro` | Terminal-based text editor       | `winget install zyedidia.micro`   |
| `rclone` | Google Drive integration    | Manual install from [rclone.org](https://rclone.org/downloads) |

These tools are used for interactive prompts and editing operations. If not installed, Borg scripts may fall back to simpler prompts or raise an error.

---

## üß™ Getting Started

> PowerShell 7.5.1 and Docker Desktop are required.

### Install via Git Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/borg.git
```

### Install via PowerShell Gallery (if published)
```powershell
Install-Module Borg -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Inject into your PowerShell profile
```powershell
# >>> BORG INITIALIZATION START <<<
Import-Module Borg
# Optionally create a shortcut alias
Set-Alias b borg
# <<< BORG INITIALIZATION END >>>
```

### Initialize Configuration

When you run any BORG command for the first time, a default `store.json` file will be created in the `data/` folder using `store.example.json` as a template (if it doesn't already exist).

To edit your configuration, you can use:

```powershell
# Open the config file using Micro (or your preferred text editor):
borg store
```

Alternatively, you can open `data\store.json` in any text editor like Notepad, VS Code, or others.


Example configuration:
```json
{  
  "Docker": {
    "SqlContainer": "sqlserver-2022",
    "SqlInstance": "localhost,2022",
    "SqlImageTag": "mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest",
    "SqlPort": 1433,
    "SqlUser": "sa",
    "SqlPassword": "yourStrong(!)Password"
  },
  "Bookmarks": [
    { "alias": "dtemp", "path": "D:\temp" },
    { "alias": "kit",   "path": "C:\Users\youruser\kits" }
  ]
}
```

## Known Issues
Error: Profile cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
Solution:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```

## üîÑ How It Works

1. Starts SQL Server container (2022 by default)
2. Prompts for `.bak` file and target name
3. Uploads `.bak` to the container
4. Executes an internal `.sh` restore script
5. Maps logical names automatically
6. Done.

---

## üîí Compatibility

- ‚úÖ SQL Server 2022
- ‚úÖ PowerShell 7.5.1+ (Windows Powershell is not supported)
- ‚úÖ Docker (Windows, Linux)
- ‚úÖ ODBC Driver 18+ (TLS-safe)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Drive Integration (via rclone)

To enable file uploads to Google Drive, BORG relies on [rclone](https://rclone.org), a powerful CLI tool for managing cloud storage.

### Setup Steps

1. Download `rclone.exe` from [rclone.org/downloads](https://rclone.org/downloads) and place it in a known location (e.g. `C:\utility-scripts\rclone.exe`).

2. Follow the [rclone Google Drive setup guide](https://rclone.org/drive/) to create a remote configuration and generate your `rclone.conf`.

3. In your `store.json`, specify:
   - The full path to `rclone.exe`
   - The remote name and optional working path (e.g. subfolder)

Example `store.json` snippet:
```json
"Rclone": {
  "ExecutablePath": "C:\\utility-scripts\\rclone.exe",
  "RemoteName": "gdrive",
  "RemotePath": "borg-backups"
}
```

Make sure your `rclone.conf` includes the credentials for the `gdrive` remote, and that you‚Äôve granted it access to the intended Google Drive folder.

Once configured, use:

```powershell
borg gdrive upload
```

to upload files interactively using `fzf` from the current directory.

## üßπ Uninstalling BORG

If you want to remove the BORG module:

```powershell
Uninstall-Module Borg -AllVersions -Force
```

To remove it manually:

```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\Borg" -Recurse -Force
```

To clean it from your profile:

```powershell
(Get-Content $PROFILE) | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch 'Import-Module Borg' } | Set-Content $PROFILE
```
